"Austin Powers in Space" is one way to describe this campy **[space comedy](https://myanimelist.net/anime/20057/Space%E2%98%86Dandy?q=space%20dandy)** from the director and producer of *Cowboy Bebop*, which follows a human, a catlike alien, and his suspiciously vacuum-cleaner-like robot companion as they catalog new alien life - and tackle plenty of obstacles along the way.
