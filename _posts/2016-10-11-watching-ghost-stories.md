After this originally serious [show](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1281/Gakkou_no_Kaidan?q=ghost%20stories) about an elementary schooler and her friends finding themselves burdened with banishing ghosts tanked in Japan, it was handed over to ADV Films for English dubbing with instructions that essentially amounted to 'go wild'. The result? A hilarious, to-the-point comedy in the style of *Abridged* series.
