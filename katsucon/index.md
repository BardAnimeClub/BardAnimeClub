It’s become a tradition every year for the club to take a trip down to Katsucon, a three day Anime convention held near Washington, DC. The convention takes place during the second week of February when the winds from the river are freezing cold, but with over ten thousand attendees at the convention, things quickly warm up. Whether you enjoy cosplaying (and taking pictures with your favorite characters), playing video games, learning about Japanese culture, or just watching great shows, Katsucon has all of it, non-stop for three whole days. Katsucon also boasts a merchant’s room and an artist alley, giant rooms filled with merchandise and artwork. Don’t forget to bring enough cash with you! But the best part of attending an Anime convention is doing it with all of you friends. Staying up late to go to a panel together or doing a joint cosplay, you’ll have plenty of stories to bring back by the time the convention’s over.
