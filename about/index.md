The Bard Anime Club was established in 2009 with the intention of joining students together over a shared love of Japanese animation. We meet every Thursday night at 7:30 P.M. in Hegeman 308 to watch episodes of shows that the club decides on at the beginning of the year in addition to other events that fall outside of the weekly meetings, the most notable (and exciting) of which being our yearly trip to Katsucon in Washington, D.C. in the third week of February. 

Our doors are always open to new members and guests, so feel free to drop in!
